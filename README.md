# XP Core Values 
## Communication and Feedback
  - Our team maintained open communication through regular daily stand-ups, where each member shared their progress, explained their responsibilities, and received feedback when necessary. In these meetings, we ensured that everyone understood what was needed to be done for the project. Team members collaborated and helped resolve challenges when they arose.  Communication and feedback together played a critical role in maintaining alignment, improving outcomes, and adapting effectively to changes throughout the project.
